# SoundSynthesizer
This project is a guitar simulator which simulates guitar-like sounds using various data structures.

In this project, datastructures ArrayDeque, LinkedDeque, and CircularArrayFixedSizeQueue are created and used to synthesize guitar sound.
Once both the CircularArrayFixedSizeQueue and CircularArrayFixedSizeQueueGuitarString classes are complete, you should be able to run GuitarHero. The purpose of this class is to create a simulator that supports a total of 37 notes on the chromatic scale from 110 Hz to 880 Hz.
The keyboard imitates a piano, such that the white keys are on the qwerty and zxcv rows and the black keys are on the 12345 and asdf rows of the keyboard. For each note, you should expect a sharp pluck at the beginning followed by an attenuation as the sound gets quieter.
